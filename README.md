```
https://github.com/omerahat/Worldle_Clone.git
```
2. Open Worldle_Clone.ipynb in a program that supports the .ipynb format.

(Here is some examples for that: Jupyter Notebook (cross-platform), Jupyter Notebook Viewer (Web), Cantor (Linux), or Google Colaboratory (Web))

3. Run all code blocks including game().

4. And that's it! You can start to guess what the country shown above is.
